Amazon Redshift and Aginity SQL work

Hello World,

This is my 2nd SQL-based repository. This is code that I'm writing professionally, 
  and would like a record of to see my thought process and logic over the course of my SQL-growth.
  
I connected to Amazon Redshift Aginity Workbench using a VPN and PuTTY. Typical data pulled ranges anywhere from 1-100000 lines. 

The 2 biggest things I need to remember for my future development: always save your work, and don't get lost in aesthetics.

Thanks for the read. Good luck, me. 

Best,
Zain
